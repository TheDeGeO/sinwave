## 1. Basics of Chord Construction
At its core, a chord is a group of **at least three notes** played simultaneously. The most common approach to building chords is by **stacking thirds** (skipping every other note in a scale). This foundational concept gives us the building blocks for virtually all chord types in Western music.

### The Basic Triads
Triads are the simplest complete chords, consisting of three notes: the **root** (which gives the chord its name), the **third** (which largely determines if the chord sounds "happy" or "sad"), and the **fifth** (which adds fullness and stability).

> **Insight:** The third is the most crucial interval for determining a chord's emotional quality. Major thirds (4 semitones above the root) create a bright, resolved feeling, while minor thirds (3 semitones above the root) evoke a darker, more melancholic quality.

| Chord Type   | Formula     | Example (C as root) | Common Notation |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Major       | 1 - 3 - 5   | C - E - G           | C, Cmaj, CM     |
| Minor       | 1 - ♭3 - 5  | C - E♭ - G          | Cm, Cmin, C-    |
| Diminished  | 1 - ♭3 - ♭5 | C - E♭ - G♭         | Cdim, C°        |
| Augmented   | 1 - 3 - ♯5  | C - E - G♯          | Caug, C+        |

These four basic triads form the foundation of chord theory. You'll find them everywhere in music, from simple folk songs to complex classical compositions. Understanding how they're constructed is essential before moving on to more complex chord structures.

> **Musical Application:** Try playing each of these triads on your instrument and listen carefully to their distinct qualities:
> - **Major**: Bright, happy, resolved
> - **Minor**: Melancholic, somber, serious
> - **Diminished**: Tense, unstable, wanting to resolve
> - **Augmented**: Mysterious, dreamlike, floating

## 2. Seventh Chords (Four Notes)
When we add a fourth note – specifically a seventh interval above the root – we enter the world of seventh chords. These four-note chords add richness and complexity to the basic triads, creating more nuanced emotional qualities and harmonic functions.

The seventh interval comes in two main varieties: the major seventh (11 semitones above the root) and the minor seventh (10 semitones above the root). The combination of these seventh types with different triads gives us our palette of seventh chords.

> **Insight:** The dominant seventh chord (simply written as "C7" for the key of C) has been called the "engine" of Western music because of its strong tendency to resolve to the tonic chord. This tension and resolution is the fundamental driving force behind much of functional harmony.

| Chord Type         | Formula         | Example (C as root) | Common Notation   |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Major 7th          | 1 - 3 - 5 - 7  | C - E - G - B       | Cmaj7, CM7        |
| Dominant 7th       | 1 - 3 - 5 - ♭7 | C - E - G - B♭      | C7                |
| Minor 7th          | 1 - ♭3 - 5 - ♭7| C - E♭ - G - B♭     | Cm7, Cmin7        |
| Half-diminished 7th| 1 - ♭3 - ♭5 - ♭7| C - E♭ - G♭ - B♭   | Cø7, Cm7♭5        |
| Diminished 7th     | 1 - ♭3 - ♭5 - ♭♭7| C - E♭ - G♭ - A   | Cdim7, C°7        |
| Minor Major 7th    | 1 - ♭3 - 5 - 7 | C - E♭ - G - B      | CmM7, Cm(maj7)    |

> **Genre Context:**
> - **Jazz**: Makes extensive use of maj7, m7, and dominant 7th chords
> - **Blues**: Dominant 7th chords are central to the blues sound
> - **Classical**: Carefully uses dominant 7th chords for resolution points
> - **Pop**: Often simplifies to triads, but may use 7ths as "color tones"

## 3. Extended Chords (Ninth, Eleventh, Thirteenth)
Once we've understood triads and seventh chords, we can continue stacking thirds to create what are known as "extended chords." These include 9th, 11th, and 13th chords, which add increasing levels of color and complexity to the harmony.

Extended chords are particularly important in jazz, fusion, and modern R&B, where rich harmonies help create the distinctive sound of these genres. In classical music, these sonorities might be analyzed differently (as added-note chords or suspensions), but in modern chord notation, they're recognized as extensions.

> **Important:** In jazz chord notation, extensions usually imply that all the lower extensions are present as well. So a C13 chord typically includes the 7th, 9th, and 11th (though the 11th is often omitted due to dissonance with the 3rd).

| Chord      | Formula                | Example (C root)         | Notes                        |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| C9         | 1 - 3 - 5 - ♭7 - 9     | C - E - G - B♭ - D       | Dominant 9th                 |
| Cmaj9      | 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9      | C - E - G - B - D        | Major 9th                    |
| Cm9        | 1 - ♭3 - 5 - ♭7 - 9    | C - E♭ - G - B♭ - D      | Minor 9th                    |
| C11        | 1 - 3 - 5 - ♭7 - 9 - 11| C - E - G - B♭ - D - F   | 11th often clashes with 3rd  |
| C13        | 1 - 3 - 5 - ♭7 - 9 - 11 - 13| C - E - G - B♭ - D - F - A | Complete extended chord |

While these chords contain many notes on paper, in practice, musicians often omit certain tones to make them more manageable. The 5th is commonly removed as it adds little character to the chord. In larger ensembles, different chord tones are distributed among instruments.

> **Practical Tip:** When voicing extended chords on piano or guitar, focus on including:
> - The root (though bass players often cover this)
> - The 3rd (critical for determining major/minor quality)
> - The 7th (important for the chord function)
> - The extension(s) that give the chord its name

## 4. Altered and Suspended Chords
Beyond the standard chord constructions, we have special chord types that either alter certain chord tones or replace them altogether. These create distinctive sounds that are used across many musical genres.

### Suspended Chords
Suspended chords temporarily replace the third with either a second (sus2) or a fourth (sus4), creating an unresolved, "suspended" feeling that typically wants to resolve back to a triad.

| Chord   | Formula   | Example     | Sound Character         |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Csus2   | 1 - 2 - 5 | C - D - G   | Open, ambiguous         |
| Csus4   | 1 - 4 - 5 | C - F - G   | Tense, wanting resolution|

> **Historical Note:** Suspended chords originated in classical music as suspensions—dissonances created when a note is held over from a previous chord while the other voices change. In modern music, they're treated as independent chord types and don't necessarily resolve as they traditionally would.

### Altered Dominants
Altered dominants modify the basic dominant 7th chord by raising or lowering certain tones (typically the 5th and/or 9th). These alterations create more tension, making the chord's resolution even more satisfying.

| Chord   | Formula         | Example (C root)         | Common Use                  |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| C7♯5    | 1 - 3 - ♯5 - ♭7 | C - E - G♯ - B♭         | Pre-resolution tension      |
| C7♭5    | 1 - 3 - ♭5 - ♭7 | C - E - G♭ - B♭         | Jazz, blues transitions     |
| C7♭9    | 1 - 3 - 5 - ♭7 - ♭9 | C - E - G - B♭ - D♭ | Strong tension, especially minor key progressions |
| C7♯9    | 1 - 3 - 5 - ♭7 - ♯9 | C - E - G - B♭ - D♯ | The "Hendrix chord," blues-rock |
| C7alt   | Various alterations | C - E - G♯/♭ - B♭ - D♭/♯ | Modern jazz, maximum tension |

> **Sound Exploration:** The C7♯9 chord (C-E-G-B♭-D♯) is famously known as the "Hendrix chord" for its prominent use in "Purple Haze." Its distinctive dissonant quality comes from the clash between the major third (E) and the augmented ninth (D♯), which is enharmonically equivalent to a minor third (E♭). This creates a sound that's simultaneously major and minor.

## 5. Chord Inversions
Inversions occur when a chord's bass note is something other than its root. They create smoother voice leading, interesting bass lines, and altered chord colors while maintaining the basic harmonic function.

Inversions are notated using "slash notation," where the letter after the slash indicates the bass note.

| Triad Position   | Notes (C major) | Notation | Traditional Symbol |
|------------------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| Root position    | C - E - G       | C        | 5/3               |
| 1st inversion   | E - G - C       | C/E      | 6/3 or 6          |
| 2nd inversion   | G - C - E       | C/G      | 6/4               |

For seventh chords, we have one additional inversion:

| Seventh Chord Position | Notes (C7)        | Notation |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Root position          | C - E - G - B♭    | C7       |
| 1st inversion          | E - G - B♭ - C    | C7/E     |
| 2nd inversion          | G - B♭ - C - E    | C7/G     |
| 3rd inversion          | B♭ - C - E - G    | C7/B♭    |

> **Creative Application:** The 2nd inversion (6/4 chord) often creates a slightly unstable feeling, making it useful for cadential moments. The 1st inversion provides a smoother bass line and maintains a strong harmonic foundation. The 3rd inversion (with the 7th in the bass) creates maximum instability and practically demands resolution.

## 6. Chord Naming Summary
Understanding chord names means breaking them down into their components, which follow a logical structure:

`[Root][Quality][Extension][Alterations][Additions][Slash Bass]`

This formula helps us decode even the most complex chord symbols. Let's analyze some examples:

| Chord Symbol | Breakdown                        | Meaning                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Cmaj7        | C + major quality + major 7th    | C major triad with a major 7th (B)      |
| C7♯9         | C + dominant quality + sharp 9th | C dominant 7 with D♯ instead of D       |
| Cadd9        | C + major quality + added 9th    | C major with added D, but no 7th        |
| Cm7♭5        | C + minor quality + 7th + flat 5th | C half-diminished (minor 7th flat 5) |
| C/E          | C major with E bass              | 1st inversion of C major                |
| Csus4        | C + suspended 4th                | C with F replacing E                    |

> **Reading Tips:** When encountering an unfamiliar chord symbol, break it down from left to right:
> 1. Identify the root note
> 2. Determine the basic quality (major, minor, etc.)
> 3. Look for extensions (7, 9, etc.)
> 4. Note any alterations (♭5, ♯9, etc.)
> 5. Check for additions or omissions
> 6. Look for slash notation indicating bass note

## 7. Jazz Voicing Notes
In jazz contexts, chord voicings often differ from their theoretical constructions. Jazz musicians frequently employ techniques that streamline chords while maintaining their essential character.

Common practices include:
- **Omitting the fifth** - The perfect fifth adds little harmonic color and is often the first note to be dropped
- **Omitting the root** - When playing with a bassist, other instrumentalists may leave out the root
- **Shell voicings** - Using just the essential tones (root, 3rd, 7th) to outline the harmony
- **Quartal voicings** - Stacking fourths instead of thirds for a modern sound (common in post-bop jazz)
- **Drop voicings** - Moving specific chord tones down an octave to create more spread-out, playable shapes

> **Pianistic Insight:** When playing a Cmaj13 chord, a pianist might voice it as E-B-D-G-A (3-7-9-5-13), omitting the root and 11th entirely. This creates a clean, modern sound that a bassist can complement by playing the root.

## 8. Modal and Exotic Chords
Beyond the standard chord constructions found in functional harmony, modern music has embraced a wide range of alternative chord structures derived from modes, symmetrical scales, and non-Western musical traditions.

| Chord Type        | Example                  | Common In                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Quartal chords    | C - F - B♭ - E♭         | Modern jazz, impressionism |
| Quintal chords    | C - G - D - A           | Folk, modern classical     |
| Modal clusters    | D Dorian: D - F - A - C - E | Modal jazz, film music |
| Polychords        | C/D (C major over D major) | 20th century classical, fusion |

> **Creative Applications:** These non-tertian chord structures offer fresh sonic possibilities:
> - **Quartal harmony** - Used extensively by McCoy Tyner and Chick Corea to create open, ambiguous sounds
> - **Modal chord planing** - Moving parallel chord structures through a mode (as in Debussy's music)
> - **Polychords** - Creating harmonic complexity through the superimposition of simpler structures

## Conclusion
Mastering chord nomenclature opens up a world of harmonic possibilities. From the foundational triads to complex extended and altered chords, this language of harmony allows musicians to communicate and explore the rich palette of musical colors available.

Remember that while these naming conventions provide a useful framework, music is ultimately about sound and expression. Use these tools to enhance your musical vocabulary, but always let your ears be the final judge.

**Further Exploration:** For more depth on this topic, I recommend experimenting with these chord types on your instrument, analyzing the chord progressions in your favorite songs, and exploring how different genres prioritize different chord types and extensions.
